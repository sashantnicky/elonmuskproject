    <h2>Elon Reeve Musk</h2>
    <p>Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is an engineer, industrial designer, philanthropist,
        and technology entrepreneur.[2][3][4] He is a citizen of South Africa, the United States (where he
        has lived most of his life and currently resides), and Canada.[note 1] He is the founder, CEO and chief
        engineer/designer of SpaceX;[6] co-founder,[7] CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;[8][9] founder
        of The Boring Company;[10] co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI.
        [11] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[12][13] In December 2016, he was ranked
        21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People,[14] and was ranked joint-first on the Forbes
        list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019.[15] He has a net worth of $27.9 billion and is listed by
        Forbes as the 20th-richestperson in the world.He is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer
        globally.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving
        to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania
        two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School and a bachelor's
        degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material
        sciences at Stanford University in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue a business career. He
        subsequently co-founded (with his brother Kimbal) Zip2, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq
        for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which
        had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October
        2002.</p>

    <h2 id="section2">Early Life</h2>
    <p>Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,the son of Maye Musk (née Haldeman),
        a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,[27][28][29] and Errol Musk, a South African
        electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor.[30] He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger
        sister, Tosca (born 1974).[34][29] His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born
        Canadian.[35] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.After his
        parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria,[36] a choice he made
        two years after his parents separated but which he subsequently regretted.[38] Musk is estranged from his
        father, whom he has referred to as "a terrible human being."[38] He also has a half-sister[39] and a
        half-brother.</p>
    <p>During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.[41] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing
        while using the Commodore VIC-20.[42] He taught himself computer programming and, by the age of 12, sold
        the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for
        approximately $500.[43][44] His childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which he
        drew the lesson that "you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization,
    minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one".</p>
    <p>Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School[45] before graduating from Pretoria
        Boys High School.[46] Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became
        determined to move to the United States, saying "I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great
        things are possible, more than any other country in the world."[47] Musk knew it would be easier to get to
        the United States from Canada and moved there against his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th
        birthday,[48] after obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.</p>

    <h2 id="section3">Education</h2>
    <p>While awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months.
        Once in Canada, Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory service in the South
        African military.[52] He left in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania;
        he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts
        degree in physics.</p>
    <p>In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called
        Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the
        Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games.[55] Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple’s
        QuickTime who had hired Musk, noted: “He had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware
        or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to
        just go figure things out.”</p>
    <p>In 1995, Musk commenced a PhD in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California.
        Eager to pursue opportunities in the Internet boom, however, he dropped out after just two days to launch
        his first company, Zip2 Corporation.</p>

            In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from
            a small group of angel investors.[38] The company developed and marketed an internet city guide for the
            newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions and yellow pages[59], with the vector graphics
            mapping and direction code being implemented by Musk in Java.[60] Musk obtained contracts with The New
            York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[61][62] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a
            merger with CitySearch.[63] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[41] Compaq acquired
            Zip2 for US$307 million in cash[41]:109 in February 1999.[64] Musk received US$22 million for his 7
            percent share from the sale.</p>
        <h3 id="X.com and PayPal">X.com and PayPal</h3>
            <p>In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company,
                with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2.[63][62] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,
                which had a money-transfer service called PayPal.[62] The merged company focused on the PayPal
                service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[66] Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as
                CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company executives over
                his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.[67] In October 2002,
                PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165 million.
                Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's
                shares.</p>
            <p>In July 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount,
                stating that it has sentimental value to him.</p>
        <h3 id="SpaceX">SpaceX</h3>
            <p><img src="th (2).jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="SpaceX image">
                In 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse
                on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest
                in space exploration.[71][72] In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace
                supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr
                Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The
                group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was
                seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.[73] The group
                returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for
                three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm,
                In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker
                of satellites and spacecraft.The group had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket
                for US$8 million. Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the meeting. On the flight
                back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets
                he needed.[73] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[74] Musk calculated that
                the raw materials for building a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time.
                It was concluded that, in theory, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach employed
                in software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent
                gross margin.[75] Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a true
                spacefaring civilization</p>
            <p>With US$100 million of his early fortune,[77] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or
                SpaceX, in May 2002.[78] Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer (CTO) of
                the Hawthorne, California-based company. By 2016, Musk's private trust held 54% of SpaceX stock,
                equivalent to 78% of voting shares.
                SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket
                technology. The company's first two launch vehicles were the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to
                Star Wars' Millennium Falcon), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic Dragon).
                [80] SpaceX designed the family of Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon multipurpose spacecraft over
                a span of seven years. In September 2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded
                liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth orbit.</p>
        <h3 id="Tesla">Tesla</h3>
            <p><img src="th (1).jpg">Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and
                Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[109] Both men played
                active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.[110] Musk led the
                Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman.
                All three, along with J. B. Straubel, were inspired by the earlier AC Propulsion tzero electric
                roadster prototype.[114] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product
                design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.
                Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard
                was ousted from the firm.[88][116] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect
                in 2008, positions he still holds today. As of 2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any
                automotive manufacturer globally.</p>
